# database

A database homework.

Based my database on the 2020 season of F1 World Championship. It’s a series of car races. There are 10 teams (also know as constructors, they construct the car) and each team has 2 drivers (substitutes excluded). In 2020 there were 17 races in various countries and various race tracks. My entities are on constructors, drivers, races, tracks and the top three finishers of races. 

There are two kinds of championships in the series; constructors’ championship and drivers’ championship. The pilot and the constructor that gets the most points depending on their results in 17 races become champions in their own categories, often the champion pilot is a driver of the champion constructor.
